# Dialogue to JSON
 A JSON-based dialogue writing tool. Write lines of dialogue and export your script as a JSON file. Import previous JSON scripts and edit them as well.

 Try out the tool [here](https://tumblefox.github.io/Dialogue-to-JSON "here").

 ## Usage
 ### Presets
 Three presets inputs exist to add characters, character moods, and actions the characters can perform during a line of dialogue labelled Character, Expressions, and Actions, respectively.

 One new entry for each input is created by a new line entry (technically the newline character "\n").

### Adding Lines of Dialogue
The "ADD" button opens a form that allows you to add dialogue. The form includes the presets you specified above as options.

### Editing Dialogue
By hovering over a speech bubble, two buttons become visible: "EDIT" and "DELETE." The former loads a form to allow you to edit the dialogue and the latter allows you to remove dialogue.

### Importing and Exporting
By clicking "SAVE FILE," all of your dialogue will be exported as a .JSON file. A .JSON file created with this tool can be loaded by clicking "OPEN FILE" and accepting all prompts.
